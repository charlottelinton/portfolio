      <h1>What are Html5 Semantic Elements?</h1>

      <p>Semantic elements are elements with a <strong>meaning</strong>. Within html5, this means
        using elements (or tags) with a clearly defined meaning that is easily interpreted by the
        user and the browser. This is in contrast to the previous practice of using div or span tags,
        with IDs and classes, which tell the user nothing about their content.</p>

      <p>The some important advantages of the use of semantic elements are: Cleaner markup - Developers' code
        is more readable and easier to maintain; Communication - Browsers and search engines are better able
        to determine the meaning of the page and content; Accessibility - Allows screen readers and other
        assistive technologies to better understand the meaning and structure of the page.</p>
